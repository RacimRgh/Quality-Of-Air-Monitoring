## Description
This application uses Android sensors to monitor a location's ambient temperature and humidity
It offers the possibility of creating an account using your full name, email address and a password. It fully handles the validation process and database connection.
We added a boarding screen that appears when the application is started for the first time, this screen summarises the functionalities of the application. 
A monitoring of weather data (humidity, temperature) has been set up as the basic activity making it possible to provide the service requested by the user.
We have also set up an activity to view the history of data (temperature, humidity) recorded for a given position, and transcribe them in the form of a graph which allows to study the data in statistical form
